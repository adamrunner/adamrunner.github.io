I'm Adam Runner, and I build things for the internet. I work at [COPIOUS](http://copio.us) as a Software Engineer. I specialize in Ruby on Rails, but I also build with JavaScript, Backbone, Ember and I like to tinker with electronics and circuits too.

I'm also a motorcycle enthusiast and avid rider - well I was until May 2015 when I was involved in a serious accident.
