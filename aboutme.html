<p>I'm Adam Runner, and I build things for the internet. I work at <a href="http://copio.us" target="_blank">COPIOUS</a> as a Software Engineer. I specialize in Ruby on Rails, but I also build with JavaScript, Backbone, Ember and I like to tinker with electronics and circuits too. I also love craft beer and coffee.</p>

<!-- <p>I'm also a motorcycle enthusiast and avid rider - well I was until May 2015 when I was involved in a serious accident. I haven't gotten back on a bike since, but I probably will. But please! Watch out for motorcycles, and motorcyclists: wear your gear! It'll save your life!</p> -->
<p>This is a line graph of the temperature in my apartment in Portland, OR. The data comes from a DS18S20 temperature sensor and is sent to the internet via a ESP8266 (ESP-01) microcontroller / wifi device. The raw data is stored on <a href="https://data.sparkfun.com/output/ZGRYvQ5b3gHl5rwqbKoj">data.sparkfun.com</a> it sends a request to their server every 10 minutes with the current temperature in degrees fahrenheit.</p>
<p>The line graph is drawn by gathering the data from the SparkFun JSON API, and feeding it to Google's JavaScript Charting library.</p>
