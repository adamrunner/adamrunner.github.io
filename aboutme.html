<p>I'm Adam Runner, and I build things for the internet. I work at <a href="http://copio.us" target="_blank">COPIOUS</a> as a Senior Software Engineer. I specialize in Ruby on Rails, but I also build with JavaScript, Backbone, Ember and I like to tinker with electronics and circuits too. I also love craft beer and coffee.</p>
<p>The majority of my work is done on the <a href="https://www.rejuvenation.com" target="_blank">Rejuvenation</a> ecommerce application, which is a custom Ruby on Rails application.</p>
<p>This blog serves as a spot to write problems (and solutions) down, in the hopes that they'll help or inspire someone, some day.</p>

<p>I've built many different things that interact with the internet, like <a href="/2016-02-27-esp8266-adventures">temperature monitoring sensors</a>. I also love to try out new technologies, like <a href="/2016-04-24-lets-encrypt-everything/">free SSL services</a>.</p>

<p>I also currently collect data regarding the temperature inside my apartment, and for my neighborhood in SW Portland, Oregon. I display this information on an <a href="/temp_graph">interactive graph.</a></p>
