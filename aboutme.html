<p>I'm Adam Runner, currently I am a Senior Software Engineer that is looking for work. Previously I was Senior Software Engineer for <a href="https://www.rejuvenation.com/" target="_blank">Rejuvenation</a>. I've been developing software in the ecommerce industry since 2011, prior to moving into software development I worked in the computer repair / support industry. Supporting both business and residental customers. </p>
<p>Some of the technologies I play nicely with are: Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, JavaScript, Backbone(rip), React, VueJS, PostgreSQL,MongoDB, MySQL, CoffeeScript (rip), Chef, Redis.</p>
<p>This blog serves as a spot to write problems (and solutions) down, in the hopes that they'll help or inspire someone, some day. Also, it works as quite an easy to find documentation system for some of the problems that I've ran into over the years.</p>
